# Telangana Growth Analysis

---

## Objective:
The prime intent of this project is to thoroughly investigate the growth metrics of Telangana using datasets related to Stamp Registration, Transportation, and TS-iPASS. With a deep dive into these datasets, the goal is to:
- Grasp the dataset attributes, categories, and associated time frames.
- Discern trends and patterns within each domain.
- Identify areas of growth opportunities and those that necessitate attention.
- Discover correlations among these sectors and delineate the comprehensive growth trajectory of the state.
- Present the insights complemented by appropriate visuals such as shape maps.

## Primary Research Questions:

### Stamp Registration:
1. Analyze the variation in revenue from document registration across Telangana's districts. Which five districts demonstrated the most robust growth in document registration revenue between FY 2019 and 2022?
2. Compare the revenue from document registration to e-stamp challan revenue across districts. Which districts in FY 2022 saw a more significant chunk of their revenue coming from e-stamps than from documents?
3. Post the implementation of e-Stamp challan, has there been a shift in the pattern of e-Stamp challan count versus document registration count? What suggestions could enhance this?
4. Segment the districts into three categories based on stamp registration revenue for FY 2021-2022.

### Transportation:
5. Delve into potential correlations between vehicle sales and specific months or seasons across districts. Are some months consistently higher or lower in sales, and what could be the reasons? (Focus on Fuel-Type category).
6. Examine how vehicles, based on their class (e.g., Motorcycle, MotorCar, AutoRickshaw, Agriculture), are distributed across districts. Are any districts demonstrating a clear preference?
7. Highlight the top 3 and bottom 3 districts in terms of vehicle sales growth during FY 2022 versus FY 2021 (Specifically, considering Petrol, Diesel, and Electric categories).

### Ts-Ipass (Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self Certification System):
8. Enumerate the top 5 sectors witnessing the highest investments in FY 2022.
9. Which three districts magnetized the most significant sectoral investments from FY 2019 to 2022, and what might have contributed to these investment inflows?
10. Probe into possible correlations between district-wise investments, vehicle sales, and stamp revenues for FY 2021-2022.
11. Are there specific sectors that attracted hefty investments in multiple districts between FY 2021 and 2022?
12. Can we discern any cyclical investment patterns for certain sectors? Do some sectors get more investments during specific months?

## Datasets:
The analyses are grounded in the following datasets:
1. `dim_districts`
2. `dim_date`
3. `fact_stamps`
4. `fact_transport`
5. `fact_TS_iPASS`

For an elaborate breakdown of columns and metadata for each dataset, please consult the detailed dataset section.

## Methodology:
1. Data Understanding & Preparation: Begin by comprehensively understanding each dataset, their attributes, and data cleaning, if necessary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze each dataset individually, looking for trends, patterns, and answering the primary questions.
3. Tools & Technologies:** Deploy tools like Python, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, etc., to sift through the data.
4. Visualization:** Augment findings with apt visuals, especially using shape maps of Telangana districts, guided by `shape file_example.mp4`.
5. Recommendation & Reporting:** Post-analysis, collate insights, and present them lucidly for top-tier management. Ensure that the findings are actionable and can guide governmental strategies.

## Concluding Remarks:
The Telangana Growth Analysis project is not just a routine data analysis exercise. It's a means to aid a state in its growth journey by identifying growth avenues, areas requiring intervention, and possible correlations among various sectors. Embrace the datasets, unravel insights, and make an impact!
